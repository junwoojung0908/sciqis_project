## Projects done at Course 10387 Scientific Computing in Quantum Information Science @ DTU, Denmark

## Small_projects folder includes:

### basic_quantum_circuits.ipynb
Demonstrates basic circuits including Quantum Teleportation and Quantum Fourier Transform for three qubits.

### gaussian_states_visualization.ipynb 
Demonstrates Gaussian Operations done at Wigner state, and creates countour plot and 3D plots of the states.

### rydberg_atom_annealing.ipynb
Demonstrates Quantum Annealing done with seven-qubit Rydberg Atom Graph, and plots the time evolution of all 128 states.

### state_gate_classe.py 
Defines Gate and State based on numpy, and some basic operations (e.g. Subsystem measurement). useful_states_gates.py includes representative states and gates (e.g. Pauli Matrices, Bell states).
